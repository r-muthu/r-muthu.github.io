          <img src="assets/images/sats_data_analyst_intern.png" alt="SATS Internship" class="internship-img">
          <p>I worked on a proof-of-concept project to enhance warehouse operations using computer vision. I trained and optimized a YOLOv8 object detection model in Python, improving shipment and QR code recognition. I also developed an algorithm for PTZ camera control, enabling automated tracking and seamless preset transitions. Additionally, I automated data processing pipelines, converting COCO annotations to YOLO format and integrating video processing with Azure Blob Storage. I debugged deployment challenges on NUC devices and optimized real-time detection performance.</p>
