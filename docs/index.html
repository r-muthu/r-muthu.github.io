          <h4>Dell Workshop Resource Management App</h4>
          <div class="project-details">
            <!--img src="assets/images/___" alt="Image of our web app"-->
            <p>I collaborated in a team of 7 to develop, test, and implement a Workshop Resource Management Web Application. My role primarily involved developing and testing backend code using NodeJS/Mongoose. I did some systems testing using Cypress.</p>

            <p>I collaborated in a team of 7 to develop, test, and implement a food review application using Android Studio. My role primarily involved developing and testing backend Java code for the app, utilizing various sorting algorithms. Additionally, I crafted frontend XML code to display menu items.</p>
            <p>To see the code for the food review app, click <a href="https://github.com/nightlocky/infosys-group12-fovoroapp" class="java-link">here</a> and download 'Fovoro'. Open the folder in Android Studio in order to run the app using an emulator.</p>

          <h4>Design Thinking Project on Food Security: Supervised Machine Learning Model</h4>
          <div class="project-details">
            <p>I was part of a 5-member team that analysed the relationship between the prevalence of undernourishment and the various contributing variables, aiming to address food security in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.</p>
            <p>My main contribution involved developing, implementing, and testing code to build the model using supervised machine learning techniques, leveraging Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries.</p>
