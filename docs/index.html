          <h4>Hate Speech Classification - Machine Learning Project</h4>
          <p>I developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models for hate speech classification, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency. I implemented a logistic regression model from scratch and applied PCA for feature dimensionality reduction. To improve performance, I used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model configurations.</p>
