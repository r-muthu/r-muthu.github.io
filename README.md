## Projects
- **Hate Speech Classification - Machine Learning Project**  
  I developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models for hate speech classification, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency. I implemented a logistic regression model from scratch and applied PCA for feature dimensionality reduction. To improve performance, I used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model configurations.

- **Spoken Language Identification**  
  In a team of 3, I contributed in the development of a spoken language identification system trained on the Mozilla Common Voice dataset (9 languages). I explored state-of-the-art architectures, including CNN-BiLSTM-Attention with ResNet34/50 backbones, and implemented a modular PyTorch Trainer with early stopping, checkpointing, and performance visualization.  
  The audio pipeline included MP3‚ÜíWAV conversion, 16kHz resampling, VAD segmentation, and log-mel spectrogram extraction.

- **Dell Project: Resource Management App**  
  I collaborated in an Agile team of 7 to develop, test, and deploy a Workshop Resource Management Web Application. My primary focus was on backend development using Node.js and Mongoose, where I built and optimized database interactions and API functionality. I also contributed to system testing using Cypress, ensuring application reliability and performance.

- **SUTD Food Review App**  
  I collaborated in a team of 7 to develop, test, and implement a food review application using Android Studio. My role primarily involved developing and testing backend Java code for the app, utilizing various sorting algorithms. Additionally, I crafted frontend XML code to display menu items.

- **Design Thinking Project on Food Security**  
  I was part of a 5-member team that analysed the relationship between the prevalence of undernourishment and the various contributing variables, aiming to address food security in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. My main contribution involved developing, implementing, and testing code to build the model using supervised machine learning techniques, leveraging Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries.

- **50Arches - Light Installation**  
  I worked in a team of 5 to design and build an interactive light installation at Changi Business Park. I programmed Arduino-based touch-activated lighting effects, creating a dynamic color-changing ripple effect. I also designed 3D models and floor plans using CAD software and Adobe Illustrator, ensuring a precise and visually engaging installation.

## Extra Curricular Activities
- **Google Developer Student Club - Facilitator**  
  I hosted an internal JavaScript workshop for SUTD students, covering core programming concepts and web development. Additionally, I was part of a team that conducted an outreach workshop at Hwa Chong Institution, where I demonstrated robot mechanisms and inspired students to explore STEM.

- **Electric Vehicle Club - Member**  
  I collaborated in a team of 7 to assemble a one-seater electric go-kart. I also designed and developed custom add-on accessories using Autodesk Fusion 360, which I 3D-printed for assembly, improving the kart's functionality and aesthetics.

- **ISTD Pillar Student Representative (Senior)**  
  I am representing the interests and welfare of undergraduate students from the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar, collaborating with the 9th Student Association Council and the ISTD Undergraduate Student Board to enhance the student experience.

- **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant**  
  - *Jan 2025 ‚Äì Apr 2025 | 50.001 Information Systems and Programming*  
    Supported instruction for the module, assisting students with course material and reinforcing key programming concepts.  
  - *Sep 2023 ‚Äì Dec 2023 | 10.015 Physical World*  
    Led in-class discussions for 48 students, evaluated over 380 homework submissions, and provided constructive feedback to help students strengthen their understanding of Newtonian physics through the Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Programme (UTOP).

## Internship Experience
- **Data Analyst Intern at SATS** *(Sep 2024 ‚Äì Dec 2024)*  
  I worked on a proof-of-concept project to enhance warehouse operations using computer vision. I trained and optimized a YOLOv8 object detection model in Python, improving shipment and QR code recognition. I also developed an algorithm for PTZ camera control, enabling automated tracking and seamless preset transitions. Additionally, I automated data processing pipelines, converting COCO annotations to YOLO format and integrating video processing with Azure Blob Storage. I debugged deployment challenges on NUC devices and optimized real-time detection performance.

- **ML Research Engineer Intern ‚Äî KLASS** *(May 2025 ‚Äì Sep 2025)*  
  - I benchmarked multi-stage license plate recognition pipelines (3-stage YOLOv7 and 2-stage YOLOv10 + PARSeq) across datasets and developed an evaluation script for the 2-stage pipeline.  
  - I fine-tuned PARSeq models on day/night datasets using pretrained weights and containerized workflows with Docker to ensure reproducibility.  
  - I automated dataset curation using Python scripts, including file transfers, XML annotation filtering, and mapping of elements.  
  - I annotated object detections and OCR results using Label Studio and visualized datasets with FiftyOne to support error analysis.  
  - I built Streamlit interfaces to streamline human-in-the-loop annotation and review, gaining hands-on experience with Linux command line tools for dataset and training management.  
  - I improved my problem-solving skills by analysing blockers, seeking guidance from my supervisor, and defining the next steps.
